My solutions to the 2019 Advent of Code challenges in Rust. I'm a little late to this, but I need something to kill some time now. I'm still much of a beginner to Rust and programming in general, but I'm hoping that completing these challenges will help me refine my skills and learn new things.

---Advent of Code 2019 Challenges---

Day 1	| The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation

Day 2	| 1202 Program Alarm 
	
	--I reused my Day 2 code for Day 5 so I don't have the original files yet. I'll probably redo it later.

Day 3	| Crossed Wires

Day 4	| Secure Container

Day 5	| Sunny with a Chance of Asteroids 

Day 6 	| Universal Orbit Map

Day 7	| Amplification Circuit
